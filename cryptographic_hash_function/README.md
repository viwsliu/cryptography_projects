# Definition
A hash function is any function that can be used to transform data
of arbitrary length into data of a fixed length n.
The input to a hash function may be called a message. The output
of a hash function is called a message digest, a digest, a hash
digest, a hash value or simply a hash.
Hash functions are often many-to-one functions which can be
considered as compressing information.
