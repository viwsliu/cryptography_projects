# Basic Cryptography Project

This repo contains various cryptosystems that I am learning to implement. There may be errors in these implementations.

## Setup:
Create a py environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

pip install 
Install the dependencies - cryptography: 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run:
```bash
python ./example.py
```

To stop the python environment:
```bash
deactivate
```
